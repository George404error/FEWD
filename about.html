            <p>
                this is the grading system that is used for all climbing but the bolding.
                the grading system that is used is the French. the image will allow you to compare it to other
                languages, 1 is the esasiet and 7c is the hardest. while it can go harder than a 7c the graph shows
                the general way
                it works.
            </p>

            <p>
                this is the grading system for bolding. the one used is the USA one. in this system a VB
                is the easiest and the V17 is the harder. not while it can go higher than V17 the graph
                shows the basic patter it follows.
